# Research-Lab

Acme Inc., a British Biology research lab needs a new software system which allows them to classify the organisms that they are studying.
Please identify a few organism types and describe their characteristics and behaviours. Then, observe the relationships between.
Create a class hierarchy which expresses that classification. Use the OOP concepts and principles (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) to express your types. Through good design you'll end up reusing functionality from parent types in child types.
For each type you modelled implement the common methods we learned about: getters & setters for instance variables, toString() and equals().

Create a program which collects a set of organisms (objects) in an array. Iterate over that array and call method(s) describing common functionality. Observe which method implementation is called on each object at runtime.

Work using Maven and Git. Submit your solution as a link to your GitHub repository.
